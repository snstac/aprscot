The ``aprscot`` "APRS to Cursor On Target (COT) Gateway" provides beyond 
line-of-sight blue force tracking capabilities using commercial off the shelf 
components. This gateway uses the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) 
and APRS-IS network to forward APRS position reports to Cursor On Target (COT) 
clients such as the Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK), WinTAK, et al. Other 
situational awareness & common operating picture platforms are supported 
through use of COT, such as TAKX & COPERS.

APRS Frames can also be transformed or callsigns normalized before forwarding 
as COT.  Almost any network destination is available, including TCP & UDP 
Mulitcast.

Features of ``aprscot``:

* Handles APRS-IS transported APRS Frames from over-the-air or Internet-based stations.
* Can transform APRS station callsign, COT Type and COT Icon for display in TAK systems.
* Can run as a service ('daemon') on any Linux system.
* Can send COT Events to any destination supported by `PyTAK <https://github.com/ampledata/pytak>`_: TLS/SSL, TCP, UDP, UDP Multicast.

Support aprscot Development
============================

aprscot has been developed for the Disaster Response, Public Safety, and
Frontline community. This software is currently provided at no-cost to
our end-users. All development is self-funded and all time-spent is entirely
voluntary. Any contribution you can make to further these software development
efforts, and the mission of aprscot to provide ongoing SA capabilities to our
end-users, is greatly appreciated:

Installation
============

The APRS to COT gateway is service started with a command-line tool 
called `aprscot`. There are three options for installing `aprscot`, in order 
preferred option they are:

**Option I: Install as a Debian / Ubuntu Package**::

    $ wget https://github.com/ampledata/pytak/releases/latest/download/python3-pytak_latest_all.deb
    $ sudo apt install -f ./python3-pytak_latest_all.deb
    $ wget https://github.com/ampledata/aprs-python/releases/latest/download/python3-aprslib_latest_all.deb
    $ sudo apt install -f ./python3-aprslib_latest_all.deb
    $ wget https://github.com/ampledata/aprscot/releases/latest/download/python3-aprscot_latest_all.deb
    $ sudo apt install -f ./python3-aprscot_latest_all.deb


Option II: Install from the Python Package Index (PyPI)::

    $ pip install aprscot


Option III: Install from this source tree::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ampledata/aprscot.git
    $ cd aprscot/
    $ python setup.py install


Usage
=====

The `aprscot` program has one command-line argument::

    $ aprscot -h
    usage: aprscot [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c CONFIG_FILE, --CONFIG_FILE CONFIG_FILE

You must create a configuration file, see `example-config.ini` in the source
repository.

An example config, `COT_URL` is our COT destination server or client::

    [aprscot]
    COT_URL = tcp://takserver.example.com:8088


`APRS-IS Server-side Filter Commands <http://www.aprs-is.net/javAPRSFilter.aspx>`_ 
can be used to filter incoming APRS Frames::

    [aprscot]
    COT_URL = tcp://takserver.example.com:8088
    APRSIS_FILTER = f/W6PW-10/50

PLI Transforms can be created using per-station sections. In this example, 
we're overriding `W2GMD-9`'s COT Type & Callsign, and `NB6F-2`'s Callsign::

    [aprscot]
    COT_URL = tcp://takserver.example.com:8088

    [W2GMD-9]
    COT_TYPE = a-f-G-U-C
    COT_STALE = 600
    COT_NAME = Medic 52

    [NB6F-2]
    COT_NAME = Transport 2
